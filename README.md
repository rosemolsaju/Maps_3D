I made a cool 3D map where you can click on it to pick places, and it will show you the best routes for walking or cycling. It uses a map that looks 3D so it's fun to look at, and you can see the distance between the places you pick. If you want, you can also see which routes are best for walking or cycling. I used some easy-to-understand tools to make it work, and it’s all interactive – you just click to set your points and the map calculates everything for you! It's like a fun tool for planning walks or bike rides!
